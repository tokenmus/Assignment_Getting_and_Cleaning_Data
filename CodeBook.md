Introduction
============

This codebook describes the original dataset that our script run_analysis.R takes and provides a short description of the steps in the r script. The resulting dataset, its labels and dimensions are covered in the Codebook section.


Background
==========

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
